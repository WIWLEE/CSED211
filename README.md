# 컴퓨터 SW 시스템 개론 Lab
=======================

```
### [Lab 1] Introduction & Bitwise Operation
The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with bit-level representations of integers
numbers. You’ll solve five problems in the presentation.
```

### [Lab 2] Datalab2 - floating point
The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with bit-level representations of floating
point numbers. Youll solve six problems in the presentation.

### [LAB 3] BombLab
The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of “binary bombs” on our class machines. A binary bomb is a
program that consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin.
If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise,
the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase
has been defused.

### [LAB 4] AttackLab
The purpose of this lab is to develop a detailed understanding of the stack discipline on x86-64 processors. It involves applying a
total of five buffer overflow attacks on some executable files. There are three code injection attacks and two return-oriented
programming attacks.

### [Lab 8 & 9] Cache Lab
This lab will help you understand the impact that cache memories can have on the performance of your C
programs. The lab consists of two parts. In the first part you will write a small C program (about 200-300 lines) that
simulates the behavior of a cache memory. In the second part, you will optimize a small matrix transpose
function, with the goal of minimizing the number of cache misses.

### [LAB 10] Shell Lab
The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with the concepts of process control and signalling. You’ll do this by writing a simple Unix shell program that supports job control.

### [LAB 12 & 13] Malloc Lab
In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C programs, i.e., your own version of the
malloc, free and realloc routines. You are encouraged to explore the design space creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient and fast.
